//prompt() is a method of the Global window object 
//found in browsers. It's not part of the JavaScript 
//language. If you don't run your code in a browser or 
//an environment that supports the Browser Object Model,
// window won't be there and if window isn't there, neither 
//will prompt() be. Run your code in a browser.

//var a=5;
//console.log(a);
//we can reassign a to another type of 
//entry
//if we do not assign any thing to the
//variable,then we get the value of that
//variable in console as undefined
